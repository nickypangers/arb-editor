# Flutter ARB Editor

## Description

This is a web editor for .arb files, which are required for internationalizing flutter applications using the [official method](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization). There are other options for improving the editing experience, such as VSCode plugins.

This editor is open-sourced and free-to-use. Feel free to contribute to the project (adding features, fixing bugs).
